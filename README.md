Hi, This Bijoy.
This project is submitted as the full-fillment for "ReactJS / NextJS Assignment".

During building this project I have taken help from many online resources such as official docs, youtube video lectures and so on.

I've used MongoDB as database.

So You must need internet connection for running my project.
And There is some loading time about 1 or 2 seconds. It's actually for fetching the data from server.
So, please don't think that my project is broken. Just wait till the server response.

Thank You.
